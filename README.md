# TidyTuesday

This repository contains my contributions to the #TidyTuesday challenge, a weekly social data project that focusses on understanding how to summarise and arrange data to make meaningful and/or beautiful charts within the ```tidyverse``` (any other R packages) ecosystem.

The project was founded in 2018 by Thomas Mock and organized by the R4DS ("R for Data Science") online learning community. The intent is to provide a safe and supportive forum to practice their wrangling and data visualisation skills.

Please visit ```R``` folder to explore my contributions to weekly challenges. The official tidytuesday repository can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
